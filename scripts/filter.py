from IIR2Filter import IIR2Filter
MyFilter = IIR2Filter(order,cutoff,filterType,design='butter',rp=1,rs=1,fs=0)

At the instantiation of the filter the following parameters are compulsory:
    order:positive integer
        It represents the order of the desired filter.
        Can be odd or even number, the filter will create a chain of second
        order filters and an extra first order one if necessary.
    cutoff:array/positive float
        Depending on the desired filter 1 cutoff frequency is to be
        enetered as a positive float for low/highpass filters or
        2 cutoff frequenices to be entered in an array as positive floats
        for bandstop and bandpass filters. These cutoff frequencies can be
        either entered as normalised to the Nyquist frequency (1 =
        Nyquist frequency) or as Hz (0 < f < Nyquist), but in this case fs,
        the sampling frequency has to be passed too.
    filterType:string
        Options are: lowpass, highpass, bandpass, bandstop

The following paremeters are NON-compulsory:
    design:string
        Different types of coefficient generations
        can be chosen. The three available filters are Butterworth,
        Chebyshev type 1 or type 2.
        The options are: butter, cheby1, cheby2. If left unspecified the
        default value is butter.
    rp:positive float
        Only necessary if cheby1 is chosen to be used. It defines the
        maximum allowed passband ripples in decibels. If unspecified the
        default is 1.
    rs:positive float
        Only necessary if cheby2 is chosen to be used. It defines the
        minimum required stopband attenuation in decibels. If unspecified
        the default is 1.
    fs:positive float
        The sampling frequency should only be specified if the cutoff
        frequency(es) provided are not normalised to Nyquist already.
        In that case the sampling frequency in Hz will be used to normalise
        them.


Example:

from IIR2Filter import IIR2Filter
FilterMains = IIR2Filter(10,[45,55],'bandstop',design='cheby1',rp=2,fs=1000)

for i in range(len(mySignal)):
    mySignalFiltered[i] = FilterMains.filter(mySignal[i])

# It creates a 10th order Chebyshev type 1 bandstop filter where the cutoff
# frequencies are at 45 and 55Hz for digital signals sampled at 1000Hz.
# The filter allows a maximum of 2 dB passband ripples. The signal is then
# filtered sample by sample and stored in the mySignalFiltered array.
